0.2.0
Remade the checkbox insertion in the newgame popup, hopefully it will be less buggy
The ante counter now says directly that you are in zen mode
The restart ante button in the game over popup is now its own button instead of replacing the new game button
Remade the restart ante function, useless stuff deleted, should be fine now
